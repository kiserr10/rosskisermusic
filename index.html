    <h2> About: </h2>

    <section class="bio">
      <p>Ross Kiser is a Deep/Tech-House producer and Dj based out of Denver,
      Colorado.  Originally from Boston, Ross began producing house music in college
      and has carried the art to new heights and across genres over the last couple of
      years.  Known for being one half of the acclaimed dance music duo
      Need & Necessity, Ross has recently branched out into a solo career to focus
      on a new sound and style.  Ross has always had a love for the deeper and more
      underground side of dance music and this new direction showcases exactly that!
